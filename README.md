# Labyrinth Generation & Solving

## Overview
This project implements a **maze generation and solving system** using **depth-first search (DFS)**. The program dynamically generates **2D mazes**, visualizes them in the console, and finds the optimal path from the start to the exit.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Concepts Implemented**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Recursive Backtracking, Object-Oriented Design
- **Data Structures**: 2D Arrays, Stacks, Structs & Classes
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio, G++
- **Testing & Debugging**: Console-based testing, step-through debugging

---

## 1. Labyrinth Generation
Developed a **maze generator** using the **DFS algorithm** with **randomized backtracking**.

- **Represented the labyrinth as a structured grid**
- **Used DFS with a stack** to create a **perfect maze** (single solution, no loops)
- **Stored maze structure** in a **class-based implementation**
- **Allowed dynamic maze sizes**, with randomized start and end points

✔️ Successfully **generated and displayed mazes dynamically**  
✔️ **Ensured uniqueness of paths and structural integrity**  

---

## 2. Pathfinding & Solving
Implemented **maze-solving functionality** using **DFS traversal**.

- **Tracked visited nodes** and backtracked when necessary
- **Stored solution paths** for visualization in the console
- **Accepted maze input from files** for solving pre-defined layouts
- **Exported solutions to text files** for external reference

✔️ Successfully **found and displayed the optimal path** in generated mazes  
✔️ **Handled both interactive user input and CLI-based file input**

## Final Results
- **Generated and solved mazes of various sizes**
- **Optimized traversal algorithms for efficiency**
- **Designed reusable C++ classes for flexibility**
- **Successfully tested and validated all functionalities**
